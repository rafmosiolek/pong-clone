# Pong Clone
A Pong clone written in JavaScript

## Instructions

Give it a spin [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rafmosiolek/pong-clone/blob/master/index.html) or clone this repo and open an index.html file in your favourite browser!

Use W and S or up and down arrow keys to move your paddle. 

### Prerequisites

A computer. Atari 2600 or ZX Spectrum will do (omg look how funny I am)

## Built with

Vanilla JavaScript

Sound effects created with [Bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/)

## Possible ways of improvement

* tests, tests, tests. Work in progress, stay tuned!
* I could definitely add **start game** and **restart game** buttons
* Game is created in horizontal order, therefore it's not so mobile-friendly. I could create a vertical gameplay for devices with a screen smaller than 600px.
